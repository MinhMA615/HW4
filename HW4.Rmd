## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

#Linear Model, I don't think BAR is a good predictor for ATMP because the data seems kind of binary
#Or perhaps, linear regression isn't the best model for this. I tried log to bring points closer 
#but it still doesn't seem quite right...

#I honestly don't think I'm doing this right so I don't know what to compare to. But in general just 
#based on the initial EDA plots, I am not able to see any trend in rain fall through time. However, I 
#do think global warming is a concern and we should be making environmental choices with that issue in
#mind. I do have sympathy for the meteorologists, I'm sure it's hard to find the correct predictors at
#the correct time as "mother nature" can be ironically pretty unpredictable...
